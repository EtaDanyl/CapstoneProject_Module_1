Personal Finance Tracker

Project Overview:

The Personal Finance Tracker is a command-line program designed to help users track their income and expenses and view financial statistics. This project incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and uses a sorting algorithm (Quicksort) for organizing transactions.

  1) Transaction Management
    Add income and expense transactions.
    Categorize transactions (e.g., Rent, Food, Entertainment).
    Edit or delete a transaction.
    Store transactions persistently in a file.

    Sort transactions by desired key using Quicksort.
    Filter transactions by desired key.
    
  4) Statistics & Reports
    Show total income, total expenses, and savings.
    Generate a report with charts.

Technical Requirements

  1) Object-Oriented Design
    The program should use OOP principles

  2) Sorting Algorithm
    The program must implement Quicksort to organize transactions efficiently.
  
  3) File Handling
    Transactions must be stored in a file so that data persists between sessions.

  4) APIs
     The program should use at least one API
