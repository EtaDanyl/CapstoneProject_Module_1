Personal Finance Tracker & Budgeting Assistant

Project Overview:

  The Personal Finance Tracker & Budgeting Assistant is a command-line program designed to help users track their income and expenses, set budgets, and view financial statistics. This project incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and uses a sorting          algorithm (Quicksort) for organizing transactions.

Features:

  1) Transaction Management
    Add income and expense transactions.
    Categorize transactions (e.g., Rent, Food, Entertainment).
    Store transactions persistently in a file.
  
  2) Sorting & Filtering
    Sort transactions by date, amount, or category using Quicksort.
    Filter transactions by type (income/expense).
  
  3) Budgeting & Alerts
    Set a monthly budget for different categories.
    Alert when nearing or exceeding the budget.
    
  4) Statistics & Reports
    Show total income, total expenses, and savings.
    Display spending trends by category.
    Export reports to a text file.

Technical Requirements

  1) Object-Oriented Design
    The program should use OOP principles with the following classes:
      Transaction: Represents a financial transaction.
      FinanceTracker: Manages transactions, sorting, and budgeting.

  2) Sorting Algorithm
    The program must implement Quicksort to organize transactions efficiently.
  
  3) File Handling
    Transactions must be stored in a file (transactions.txt) so that data persists between sessions.

Future Enhancements (Optional):

  Implement user profiles to support multiple users.
  Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.
  Integrate with a database for scalable data management.
